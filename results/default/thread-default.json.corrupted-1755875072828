Monitor NVDA and QQQ intraday volatility — set mental stop-losses for newly added risk if price action goes strongly against us.\n\nNext steps\n- Monitor order fills and intraday price action; if fills differ materially from estimates I’ll adjust sizing in the next 30-minute run.\n- In the next scheduled run (in ~30 minutes), I will:\n  - Re-check portfolio and net worth\n  - Re-scan market headlines (if needed) and prices for key tickers\n  - Trim or add positions depending on momentum and risk limits\n\nIf you want different sizing, allow shorting (if equity permits), or a focus on a specific sector/stock, tell me and I’ll adapt the next run. Good luck — I’ll reconvene and act again at the next 30-minute interval.",
