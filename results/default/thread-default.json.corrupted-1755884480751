Kept a diversified base across ETFs and large caps to manage risk.\n- Mental stop/monitoring rules: Monitor intraday moves and reassess in next 30-minute cycle; be willing to trim if a position moves against us materially (e.g., >3–5% intraday) or to take profits on strong runs.\n\nNext steps\n- I will re-run analysis at the next scheduled 30-minute interval: check market movers, price action for current holdings, and adjust positions if necessary.\n- If you want a different risk posture (more aggressive or conservative), or specific limits (e.g., max % per position, hard stop-loss levels), tell me and I’ll apply them next run.\n\nIf you want immediate changes (different sells/buys or to set explicit stop-loss/take-profit orders), tell me now and I’ll act.",
