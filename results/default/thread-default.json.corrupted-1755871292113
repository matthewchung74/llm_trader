        "text": "Done — I ran a pre-market review and placed trades.\n\nSummary of actions\n- Checked portfolio and pre-market news sources.\n- Retrieved current prices for your core holdings.\n- Placed market buy orders:\n  - Bought 15 shares NVDA (order submitted). Estimated cost ≈ $2,573.55 (price used $171.57).\n  - Bought 3 shares MSFT (order submitted). Estimated cost ≈ $1,510.98 (price used $503.66).\n- Both orders show as submitted/pending (Order IDs returned). No shorts taken.\n\nWhy these trades (brief rationale)\n- Long bias heading into the market open; no strong bearish catalyst found in the single targeted market scan.\n- NVDA: momentum and secular strength in semiconductors/AI exposure — adding size within position limits.\n- MSFT: high-quality large-cap exposure to diversify tech exposure alongside QQQ and NVDA.\n- Position sizing: purchases use about $4,084.53 of cash — each new position is kept to a moderate share of the portfolio (roughly NVDA ~7% and MSFT ~4% of estimated net worth). Cash reserve retained for flexibility and risk management.\n\nEstimated portfolio snapshot (pre-fill, approximate)\n- Cash before trades: $15,979.71\n- Estimated cash after fills: ~$11,895.18\n- Holdings (prices fetched pre-market):\n  - AMZN 1 @ $222.11\n  - AVGO 5 @ $289.62\n  - MSFT now +3 (will be 4) @ $503.66\n  - NVDA now +15 (will be 20) @ $171.57\n  - QQQ 16 @ $563.80\n  - SMH 15 @ $286.83\n  - SPY 2 @ $637.48\n  - TLT 40 @ $86.89\n  - TSLA 5 @ $321.02\n  - XLE 80 @ $86.79\n  - XLF 60 @ $53.07\n- Estimated total net worth remains essentially unchanged by these buys (cash converted to holdings) — roughly ~$48.8k based on pre-market prices.\n\nRisk management & next steps\n- No short positions opened (account equity < $40k requirement for shorting per guidelines).\n- Maintain cash reserve (~$11.9k) to respond to intraday moves/rapid opportunities.\n- Monitor orders at market open — if partial fills occur I’ll adjust sizing on the next 30-min run.\n- Mental stop-loss guidance: consider ~10–15% for aggressive positions like NVDA; scale out on strong intraday gains.\n- Next scheduled run: in 30 minutes after market open I'll re-check fills, update prices, and act if needed.\n\nIf you want:\n- I can immediately fetch real-time order status and a fresh net worth snapshot (will use one API call), or\n- I can change sizing / cancel the pending orders before market open.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",
