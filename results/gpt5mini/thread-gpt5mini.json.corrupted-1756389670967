Selling NVDA (current price ~$182.68) frees cash while reducing exposure to an imminent earnings event.\n- AMZN (~$229.76) and MSFT (~$508.35) are liquid large-cap names that help diversify risk and capture broader tech/consumer strength.\n- Position sizing kept modest to avoid overconcentration and leave reserve cash for opportunistic trades.\n\nEstimated cash impact (approximate)\n- Proceeds from NVDA sell (~$1,465)\n- Cost for AMZN buy (~$919)\n- Cost for MSFT buy (~$1,017)\n- Estimated remaining cash roughly ~$350 (rounding and execution fills may change this).\n\nRisk management & next steps\n- Monitor order fills; I’ll check portfolio and market at the next scheduled run (every 30 minutes during market hours).\n- Watch NVDA around earnings — if it gaps violently, consider further trimming or re-entry depending on price action.\n- Maintain small cash buffer; avoid putting all capital into any single position.\n- Mental stop-losses set for intraday risk (typically 5–7% for these sized positions).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Immediately fetch the updated portfolio & exact order fills now, or\n- Run a targeted premarket scan for any other high-conviction opportunities (this would consume the remaining web_search allowance).\n\nWhich would you prefer?",
