        "text": "Plan summary (pre-market, 8:35 AM):\n- Market currently closed (pre-market). I prepared a short plan, checked the account, scanned pre-market movers, and executed modest, risk-managed trades to reduce concentration and diversify.\n- Key constraints: cash is low ($163.36), holdings include meaningful NVDA exposure (29 shares). Shorting not appropriate (and requires $40k+ equity). I'll keep a cash buffer and avoid overconcentration.\n\nWhat I checked\n- Portfolio (snapshot): cash $163.36. Holdings: AAPL (5), AMZN (52), AVGO (5), MDB (3), MSFT (27), NVDA (29), QQQ (17), SMH (15), XLE (15). Full trade history reviewed.\n- Market scan (one targeted search): pre-market movers & earnings catalysts showed retail and tech names in focus this morning (examples: Dollar General, Best Buy, Dell, Nvidia, etc.).\n- Current prices (pre-market quotes I fetched in batch):  \n  AAPL 231.48, AMZN 232.30, AVGO 307.78, MDB 314.66, MSFT 507.78, NVDA 179.44, QQQ 575.80, SMH 298.39, XLE 89.19, DG 111.34, BBY 70.98, DELL 133.04, FIVE 148.98, SPY 646.96.\n\nTrades submitted (pre-market orders placed)\n1) Sell NVDA — 5 shares submitted at market (order ID: 611f53e2-...). Estimated proceeds ≈ $897.65.\n   - Rationale: Trim NVDA ahead of earnings/volatile news to lock gains and reduce concentration.\n2) Buy BBY — 4 shares submitted at market (order ID: 7e4dc8e3-...). Estimated cost ≈ $284.04.\n   - Rationale: Add selective retail exposure (Best Buy) that may react to retail/earnings noise; small position for diversification.\n3) Buy DG — 3 shares submitted at market (order ID: 5eda1714-...). Estimated cost ≈ $334.02.\n   - Rationale: Add Dollar General (retail) exposure with modest sizing.\n\nEstimated post-fill cash and sizing (approximate)\n- Cash before trades: $163.36\n- + NVDA sale (~$897.65) = $1,060. ~\n- - BBY cost (~$284.04) and - DG cost (~$334.02) = remaining cash ≈ $442.  \n(Exact numbers will update after fills — pending orders are currently in pending_new status.)\n\nRisk management & next steps\n- Kept trades modest to avoid concentration and maintain a cash buffer (~$400+ estimated).\n- Monitor fills and market open reaction—confirm executed prices and update portfolio/net worth.\n- Watch NVDA closely around earnings/news. If my thesis is invalid (big gap up), consider trimming further; if it gaps down, consider opportunistic re-entry but size cautiously.\n- Set mental stop-losses for the new retail positions (e.g., 8–12%) and be ready to act in the next automated run (first intra-day check at 9:30 AM or the next 30-minute interval).\n- I’ll limit additional web searches to one targeted request if urgent news appears.\n\nIf you want:\n- I can confirm the order fills and updated portfolio/net worth as soon as orders complete.\n- Or I can place limit orders instead of market orders (if you prefer pre-market limit entries), or adjust position sizes/targets and stop-loss levels now.",
